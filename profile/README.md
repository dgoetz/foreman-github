# The Foreman Project

Foreman is a complete lifecycle management tool for physical and virtual servers. We give system administrators the power to easily automate repetitive tasks, quickly deploy applications, and proactively manage servers, on-premise or in the cloud.

## Features

### Provisioning

Provision on bare-metal (MaaS) & public or private clouds all from one place with one simple process.

### Configuration

A complete configuration management solution including an ENC for [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/nodes_external.html) and [Salt](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/tops/all/salt.tops.ext_nodes.html), built-in support for parameterized classes and hierarchical parameter storage. Or integrate Ansible by assigning roles and variables.

### Monitoring

Collect Puppet, Salt, and Ansible reports and facts. Monitor host configuration, report status, distribution, and trends.

### Orchestration

Utilize Scripts or Ansible playbooks for remote execution or pull them using MQTT.

### Content Management

To mirror and stage content like RPM and DEB packages, Container images, or any type of file have a look at [Katello](https://github.com/Katello), a fixed set of plugins for Foreman.

With a wide range of plugins, you can add even more features, not all of them can be found at this organization, so have a look at the [plugin overview](https://theforeman.github.io/foreman-plugin-overview/).
